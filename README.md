## Installation
Once we have our Github, terminal, and vscode ready to go, we need to:
npm init -y
npm install inquirer
npm install fs
      
## Usage
Enter "node index.js" into your command terminal, then it will prompt you with a series of questions. I suggest preparing links and screenshots ahead of time.
